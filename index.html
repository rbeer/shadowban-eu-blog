                The good news first: Twitter has completely removed the
                <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23QFD&src=typed_query" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#QFD</a>
                shadowban method.
                While it had been disabled for quite some time, they've now removed the 'Quality Filter' option
                from their apps, as well. So I'm pleased to announce that
                <a href="https://shadowban.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shadowban.eu</a>
                has successfully exposed and defeated one of Twitter's shadowbanning methods.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many thanks to everyone involved;
                from all users raising awareness using the <img src="img/2019-10-16_here-we-go-again/x.png" width="12" height="12" /> in their name to journalists all around
                the world writing articles about
                <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23QFD&src=typed_query" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#QFD</a>.

                Twitter doesn't get tired of making our lives hard, though.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm sure you have come across this view:
              </p>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col s12 l6 offset-l3 center-align">
                  <img class="materialboxed responsive-img z-depth-1" width="100%" src="img/2019-10-16_here-we-go-again/unavailable_well.png" />
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>
                "This Tweet is unavailable" can mean several things:
                <ul class="browser-default">
                  <li>The tweet got deleted,</li>
                  <li>you are blocked by the user</li>
                  <li>or their profile is set to private.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Well, it turns out that those aren't the only possible reasons you are seeing this message, instead of the tweet.<br />
                You guessed it; <span class="sb-text-purple">shadowban</span>!
              </p>
              <p>
                Twitter seems to flag certain images, videos and texts, which leads to their tweets being hidden behind
                this "unavailable" message. Look at this image! It shows
                <a href="https://twitter.com/FlorianGallwitz/status/1183835819062317063" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefere">a comment</a>
                you have seen and clicked on in your timeline. The tweet the comment was made on is "unavailable".
              </p>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col s12 l6 offset-l3 center-align">
                  <img class="materialboxed responsive-img z-depth-1" width="100%" src="img/2019-10-16_here-we-go-again/comment_focus.png" />
                  <span class="left-align">When viewing a comment, the tweet seems e.g. deleted</span>
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>
                After some digging, you might find
                <a href="https://twitter.com/neythomas/status/1183835218387591168" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the tweet</a>
                anyway; and it's not deleted, at all!
              </p>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col s12 l6 offset-l3 center-align">
                  <img class="materialboxed responsive-img z-depth-1" width="100%" src="img/2019-10-16_here-we-go-again/unavailable_but_existing.png" />
                  <span class="left-align">The tweet that was shown as "unavailable" <i>does</i> exist.</span>
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>
                Weird, huh? Oh, but wait! It. Gets. BETTER!<br />
                Did you notice that the hidden tweet from @neythomas is quoting someone else's tweet?
              </p>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col s12 l6 offset-l3 center-align">
                  <img class="materialboxed responsive-img z-depth-1" width="100%" src="img/2019-10-16_here-we-go-again/quoted_culprit.png" />
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>
                Indeed, it's not @neythomas' tweet that is flagged here; it's
                <a href="https://twitter.com/FRBorisBalkan/status/1183736815985025024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the quoted one</a>.
                Let's have a look at it and then visit
                <a href="https://twitter.com/FRBorisBalkan/status/1184439477428731907" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its first comment</a>.
                Actually being the next tweet of the author's thread, which lets us know that it doesn't matter who made the comment.
              </p>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col s12 l6">
                  <img class="materialboxed responsive-img z-depth-1" width="100%" src="img/2019-10-16_here-we-go-again/quoted_culprit_existing.png" />
                  <span class="left-align">The actually flagged tweet</span>
                </div>
                <div class="col s12 l6">
                  <img class="materialboxed responsive-img z-depth-1" width="100%" src="img/2019-10-16_here-we-go-again/quoted_culprit_unavailable.png" />
                  <span class="left-align">Viewing a comment also hides this tweet</span>
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>
                This then shows that quoting flagged tweets hides the quoting tweet, too.
                The heredity also does not end at the first level. If you quote a tweet that has quoted
                a flagged tweet... I think you see where this is going.<br />
                Almost like #QFD used to work, this new shadowbanning method affects everyone and -thing
                that touches tweets by Twitter deemed to be bad.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why bad? We don't know, yet.<br />
                I wouldn't call the tweets you see in this example controversial.
                They are complaining about a member of the German Green party - moreover, a member of parliament - having been interviewed by
                our public broadcasting services, without disclosing that fact. The topic of the broadcast
                is controversial, though. It's about a wholefood shop that has discontinued a brand of millet,
                because the CEO of the company producing it is a member of the German right-wing party AfD.<br />
                The Green party being far left is where people start butting heads.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here are some other examples you might want to explore:
                <ul class="browser-default">

                      Again about the public broadcasting "mishap" from the extended example in this post
                    </a>
                  </li>
                  <li>

                      Videos of Kurds attacking a Turkish Café in Germany
                    </a><br />
                    Here, all of the thread's tweets are flagged. You can click through them one by one, each
                    disrupting the thread by being shown as "unavailable".<br />
                    Please note: The first tweet claims that the videos show a mosque being attacked, which has
                    been debunked. So this one actually qualifies for false information.
